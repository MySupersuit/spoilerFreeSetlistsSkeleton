	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		This app takes a band's 20 most recent gigs and lists, in random order, the 20 most played songs
		in those gigs.
	</p>
	<p>
		It might be useful when you want to know roughly the songs that'll be played, but you don't want
		to ruin the order / opening / encore songs.
	</p>

	<p>
		All data comes from <a href="https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html">setlist.fm's API</a>
	</p>

	<p>Possible improvements on the way:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>- Recent big artists (so you don't have to think of someone to type in)</li>
		<li>- More info about the recent gigs? List of em + dates + next ones?</li>
	</ul>
</div>
